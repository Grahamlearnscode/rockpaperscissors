Create a r/p/s game that can be played from the console. 
Do this using 3 functions: Computer should choose a random entry; player should choose an entry; compare player's entry to computer's choice and then declare a winner with specifics e.g. 'You lose! Paper beats Rock'.
Make the inputs case-insensitive.
Return the results.
Create a fourth function that handles 5 rounds of gameplay and declares an overall winner.
